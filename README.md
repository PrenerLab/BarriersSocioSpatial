### Repository Purpose
**Street Barriers Project Aim 1:** Describe the social environment that the barriers exist in â€“ this involves combining multiple sources of data on the neighborhoods that the barriers are found in as well as the broader legislative process that allows the barriers to exist. We will be conducing interviews, collecting ethnographic data in the field, and identifying sources of quantitative data that can describe the neighborhoods themselves.
