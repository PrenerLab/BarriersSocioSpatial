# Research Log

### 29 Sep 2016 - CHRIS
Repository created with .gitignore, README.md, and researchLog.md files added.

### 29 Sep 2016 - JES
Added all historical census data from the [Brown LTDB project](http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/Researcher/LTDB.htm). These data contain historical data matched to 2010 Census geography boundaries. A quick description of the project:

> The LTDB provides estimates using 2010 boundaries for a standard set of variables from 1970 through 2000. These data may meet the needs of many users. As an initial step, we provide two sets of files. The "full count" files include the key variables from Census 2010 (race and Hispanic origin, age by race and Hispanic origin, household composition, and housing occupancy and tenure), with comparable variables from the censuses in 1970-2000 and adjusted to 2010 boundaries. The "sample count" files include a wide range of other variables based on sample data -- the one-in-six samples from the decennial census in 1970-2000 and the sample data from the American Community Survey for 2006-2010. These include variables such as socioeconomic characteristics that are widely used by researchers.

*Next Steps:* Both Chris and I are going to check out the structure of the datafiles and figure out how to integrate them into the existing project data.
